2015-2020

    GRADUATE RESEARCH ASSISTANT (MINNEAPOLIS, MN)

    -   Implemented spectral method in Matlab to obtain numerical
        evidence of attractor solutions for a fluid model.
    -   Proved existence of attractor solutions using techniques from
        spectral theory and published the results in top journal.
    -   Designed and wrote fast algorithm for simulating a crowd model.

2017
    TRACTORS FOR AFRICA (BURKINA FASO)

-   Acted as language and cultural liason between US team and local team
    in a rural town in Burkina Faso.
-   Wrote weekly reports for US team
-   Managed finances of local team and coordinated funds with US team

2012-2015
    SUMMER UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCES (PORTLAND, OR)

-   Coded a custom PDE solver in Python / Numpy for a nonlinear wave
    equation to find numerical evidence of blowup and presented my
    results at the Joint Mathematical Meetings.
-   Developed custom library in Mathematica to search through thousands
    of examples to help prove a statistical classification condition and
    published classification result in undergraduate journal.
-   Built and deployed a parallelized Computer Go player across a
    cluster of five machines to compare voting schemes.
-   Wrote statistical compression algorithm for a Computer Go player
    that significantly reduced memory usage and published the results in
    AI journal.
