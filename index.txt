Research

Since 2016

    HIGH-DENSITY CROWD DYNAMICS

    Developing simulation in Julia and Python with my advisor.

2015 - 2016

    1D DE GREGORIO MODEL FOR EULER EQUATIONS WITH SWIRL

    Pseudo-spectral methods to obtain numerical evidence of attractor
    solutions. My advisor, Prof Jia at IAS, and I proved local linear
    stability.

2014 (3 months)

    SINGULARITIES OF QUADRATIC NONLINEAR WAVE EQUATIONS

    Wrote a PDE solver (Python + NumPy) with conformal compactification.

2013 (3 months)

    ORBIGRAPHS - GRAPH THEORETIC ANALOGUES OF ORBIFOLDS

    Wrote library in Mathematica for testing conjectures
    computationally. Used Markov Chain theory to prove surprising
    classification result. 2013 (5 months)

    ROOT-PARALLELIZED COMPUTER GO

    Parallelized Computer Go player on a cluster of five machines.

2012 (3 months)

    WIN/LOSS STATE OPTIMIZATION

    Implemented statistical compression algorithm during freshman summer
    for my advisor’s Computer Go player.
