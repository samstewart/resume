Research Experience

2015-2020

    GRADUATE RESEARCH ASSISTANT (MINNEAPOLIS, MN)

    -   PHD PROJECT: Designing fast algorithm for simulating a crowd
        model inspired by fluid dynamics. Proving that algorithm is
        well-posed

    -   MASTERS PROJECT: Implemented spectral method in Matlab to obtain
        numerical evidence of attractor solutions for a fluid model.
        Proved existence of attractor solutions using techniques from
        spectral theory and published the results in top journal

2012-2015

    SUMMER UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCES (PORTLAND, OR)

    -   SUMMER 2014: Coded a custom PDE solver in Python / NumPy for a
        nonlinear wave equation to find numerical evidence of blowup and
        presented my results at the Joint Mathematical Meetings

    -   SUMMER 2013: Developed custom library in Mathematica to search
        through thousands of graphs to help prove a statistical
        classification condition. Published classification result in
        undergraduate journal

    -   SUMMER 2012: Wrote statistical compression algorithm for a
        Computer Go player that significantly reduced memory usage and
        published the results in AI journal. Built and deployed a
        parallelized Computer Go player across a cluster of five
        machines to compare voting schemes
