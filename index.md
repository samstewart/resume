Research
--------------------

Since 2016
:   **High-density crowd dynamics**
    
    Developing simulation in Julia and Python with my advisor.

2015 - 2016
:   **1D De Gregorio Model for Euler Equations with Swirl**

    Pseudo-spectral methods to obtain numerical evidence of attractor solutions. My advisor, Prof Jia at IAS, and I proved local linear stability.

2014 (3 months)
:   **Singularities of Quadratic Nonlinear Wave Equations**
    
    Wrote a PDE solver (Python + NumPy) with conformal compactification.

2013 (3 months)
:   **Orbigraphs - Graph Theoretic Analogues of Orbifolds**
    
    Wrote library in Mathematica for testing conjectures computationally. Used Markov Chain theory to prove surprising classification result.
2013 (5 months)

:   **Root-Parallelized Computer Go**

    Parallelized Computer Go player on a cluster of five machines.

2012 (3 months)
:   **Win/Loss State Optimization**
    
    Implemented statistical compression algorithm during freshman summer for my advisor's Computer Go player.
