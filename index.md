Research
--------------------

Since 2016
:   *High-density crowd dynamics*
    
    Developing simulation in Julia and Python

2015 - 2016
:   *De Gregorio Model for Euler Equations with Swirl*

    Pseudo-spectral methods to obtain numerical evidence of attractor solutions. We proved local linear stability

2014 (3 months)
:   *Singularities of Quadratic Nonlinear Wave Equations*
    
    Wrote a PDE solver (Python + NumPy) with conformal compactification.

2013 (3 months)
:   *Orbigraphs - Graph Theoretic Analogues of Orbifolds*
    
    Wrote library in Mathematica for testing conjectures computationally. Used Markov Chain theory to prove surprising classification result.
2013 (5 months)
:   *Root-Parallelized Computer Go*
    Parallelized Computer Go player on a cluster of five machines.

2012 (3 months)
:   *Win/Loss State Optimization*
    
    Implemented statistical compression algorithm during freshman summer for my advisor's Computer Go player.
